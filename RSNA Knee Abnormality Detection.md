# RSNA Knee Abnormality Detection Kaggle Competition

## Overview

- A single knee scan can reveal a dozen different problems. In this competition, you are tasked to build machine learning models that detect a defined set of clinically important abnormalities on knee MRI examinations.

Deadline: 2026-10-23

## Description

The knee is the most commonly injured and imaged joint in the body. Osteoarthritis alone affects an estimated 654 million people worldwide, while acute knee injuries account for 15 to 40 percent of all sports-related trauma. MRIs show clinicians ligaments, cartilage, menisci, and bone in detail, without exposing patients to radiation.

Reading those scans isn’t always straightforward. ACL and MCL tears, meniscal damage, cartilage loss, fractures, and other abnormalities can be subtle, and radiologists don’t always interpret them the same way. Access to musculoskeletal radiologists is also limited, especially outside major medical centers, leading to delays and inconsistent diagnoses.

In this competition, you will develop multimodal machine learning models to detect twelve clinically important knee abnormalities. You'll work with the first RSNA AI Challenge dataset that pairs every imaging study with its original radiology report, enabling your models to learn from both visual scans and written diagnostic text.

High-performing models can act as robust decision support tools, delivering the accuracy, consistency, and speed needed to elevate expert-level knee MRI interpretation and improve care across disparate clinic settings.

## Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated by the average area under the ROC curve between the predicted confidence scores and the observed targets across the twelve targets:


$\text{Final Score} = \frac{1}{12}\sum_{i=0}^{11} AUC_i$

The final score is, in other words, the macro-averaged AUC ROC.

## Submission File Format

For each row in the test set, you must predict a confidence score for each of the twelve target labels. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
StudyInstanceUID,ACL,MCL,Medial Meniscus,Lateral Meniscus,Medial OA,Lateral OA,PF OA,Effusion,Synovitis,Baker's,Contusion,Fracture
<uid_1>,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5
<uid_2>,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5

Note that, per the competition rules, in addition to the standard Kaggle Winners' Obligations (open-source licensing requirements, solution packaging/delivery, presentation to host), the host team also asks that you:

(i) create a short video presenting your approach and solution, and

(ii) publish a link to your open sourced code and the weights on the competition forum

(iii) Share final version of model as publicly available for open distribution and validation. Please see https://www.kaggle.com/models/tom99763/9th-place-models-rsna-iad/PyTorch/default as an example.

## Code Requirements

Submissions to this competition must be made through Notebooks. In order for the "Submit" button to be active after a commit, the following conditions must be met:

- CPU Notebook <= 9 hours run-time
- GPU Notebook <= 9 hours run-time
- Internet access disabled
- Freely & publicly available external data is allowed, including pre-trained models
- Submission file must be named `submission.csv`

Please see the Code Competition FAQ for more information on how to submit. And review the code debugging doc if you are encountering submission errors.

## Efficiency Prize Evaluation

### Efficiency Prize

We are hosting a second track that focuses on model efficiency, because highly accurate models are often computationally heavy.

For the Efficiency Prize, we will evaluate submissions on both runtime and predictive performance.

To be eligible for an Efficiency Prize, a submission:

Must be among the submissions selected by a team for the Leaderboard Prize, or else among those submissions automatically selected under the conditions described in the My Submissions tab.
- Must be ranked on the Private Leaderboard higher than the sample_submission.csv benchmark.
- All submissions meeting these conditions will be considered for the Efficiency Prize. A submission may be eligible for both the Leaderboard Prize and the Efficiency Prize.

An Efficiency Prize will be awarded to eligible submissions according to how they are ranked by the following evaluation metric on the private test data. See the Prizes tab for the prize awarded to each rank. More details may be posted via discussion forum updates.

### Efficiency Prize Evaluation Metric

We compute a submission's efficiency score by:

$\text{Efficiency} = \frac{ \text{AUC} }{ \text{Benchmark} - \max\text{AUC} } + \frac{ \text{RuntimeSeconds} }{ 32400 }$

where AUC is the submission's score on the main competition metric, Benchmark is the score of the benchmark sample_submission.csv, maxAUC is the maximum AUC of all submissions on the Private Leaderboard, and RuntimeSeconds is the number of seconds it takes for the submission to be evaluated. The objective is to minimize the efficiency score.

During the training period of the competition, you may see a leaderboard for the public test data in the following notebook, updated daily: Efficiency Leaderboard. After the competition ends, we will update this leaderboard with efficiency scores on the private data. During the training period, this leaderboard will show only the rank of each team, but not the complete score.

# RSNA Knee Abnormality Detection Data

## Dataset Description

This dataset contains knee MRI studies annotated for twelve common findings: ligament and meniscus injuries, three compartments of osteoarthritis, joint effusion, synovitis, Baker's cyst, bone contusion, and fracture. Each study comprises a collection of individual MRI sequences from a single scanning session formatted as DICOM series. Your task is to predict the per-study probability of each of the twelve findings.

Studies come from a diverse international mix of imaging sites and span a wide range of scanners, protocols, and populations. Only a small subset of training studies carry per-condition labels. We also provide the original text of the radiology report from which you may wish to derive the labels for the remaining studies.

## Files

`train.csv` One row per training study.

- `StudyInstanceUID` - Unique identifier for the study.matches the folder name under `train_series/`.
- `Report` - the free-text radiology report. May be in several languages, depending on the reporting institution. 

Twelve binary labels:

- `ACL` - anterior cruciate ligament injury (0/1)
- `MCL` - medial collateral ligament injury (0/1)
- `Medial Meniscus` - medial meniscus tear (0/1)
- `Lateral Meniscus` - lateral meniscus tear (0/1)
- `Medial OA` - osteoarthritis of the medial tibiofemoral compartment (0/1)
- `Lateral OA` - osteoarthritis of the lateral tibiofemoral compartment (0/1)
- `PF OA` - patellofemoral osteoarthritis (0/1)
- `Effusion` - joint effusion / excess fluid in the knee joint (0/1)
- `Synovitis` - inflammation of the joint lining (0/1)
- `Baker's` - Baker's cyst (0/1)
- `Contusion` - bone contusion / bone bruise (0/1)
- `Fracture` - fracture (0/1)

`train_series.csv` One row per training series. Each series is a single MRI acquisition and each study comprises several series.

- `SeriesInstanceUID` - study this series belongs to.
- `SeriesInstanceUID` - unique identifier for the series; matches the folder name under `train_series/<StudyInstanceUID>/`.
- `Fluid_Sensitive` - `1` if the sequence emphasizes fluid signal (T2, PD, STIR, and similar). `0` otherwise.
- `Fat_Suppression` - `1` if the sequence applies fat suppression, `0` otherwise. Note that although `Fluid_Sensitive` and `Fat_Suppression` are often correlated, as observed in the training set, they are not necessarily equivalent for every case.
- `Anatomical_Plane` - imaging plane: `Sagittal`, `Coronal`, or `Axial`.
  
**train_series/** Training DICOMs, organized as `train_series/<StudyInstanceUID>/<SeriesInstanceUID>/<SOPInstanceUID>.dcm`. Each `.dcm` is a single image slice. Series typically contain 20–45 slices (median 30), with a long tail out to a few hundred.

**test.csv** Example test file with three study IDs from the public test set. During scoring, this example data will be replaced with the actual test data. There are about 1300 studies in the test set. The `Report` field will not be provided at the testing stage.

- `StudyInstanceUID` - Unique identifier for the study. 

**test_series.csv** Same schema as `train_series.csv`, for the example test studies. Replaced with the real test-series descriptors during scoring.

**test_series/** Example test DICOMs, same layout as `train_series/`. Replaced with the real test DICOMs during scoring.

**sample_submission.csv** A valid submission with all label columns set to `0.5`.

## Dataset Distribution Notice

Although efforts have been made to ensure each abnormality is represented in each dataset, the prevalence of abnormalities is not guaranteed to be the same across the training, public leaderboard, and final evaluation datasets.

## DICOM Notes

Intensities, orientations, and resolutions vary across series and studies. Series come in a mix of transfer syntaxes (uncompressed Explicit VR Little Endian, JPEG Lossless, JPEG 2000, Implicit VR Little Endian). Every DICOM has been stripped to an allowlisted set of 86 metadata tags.
